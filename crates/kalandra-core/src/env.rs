//! Environment abstraction for deterministic testing.
//!
//! The `Environment` trait decouples protocol logic from system resources
//! (time, randomness, network I/O). This enables:
//!
//! - Deterministic Simulation: Turmoil provides a virtual clock and seeded RNG,
//!   allowing perfect bug reproduction.
//!
//! - Production Runtime: Tokio/Quinn implementations use real system resources
//!   without any code changes to the protocol logic.
//!
//! # Design Philosophy: "The Hollow Shell"
//!
//! Protocol state machines in `kalandra-core` are pure logic. They:
//!
//! - MUST NOT call `std::time::Instant::now()` or `tokio::time::sleep()`
//! - MUST NOT use `rand::thread_rng()` or system entropy directly
//! - MUST accept an `Environment` parameter for all side effects
//!
//! The environment is implemented twice:
//!
//! 1. `SimEnv` (kalandra-harness): Uses Turmoil's virtual time and seeded RNG
//! 2. `SystemEnv` (kalandra-server): Uses real system clock and crypto-secure
//!    RNG
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Monotonicity: `env.now()` must never go backwards
//! - Determinism: Given the same seed, `random_bytes()` produces the same
//!   sequence
//! - Isolation: Implementations must not share global state

/// Abstract environment providing time, randomness, and async primitives.
///
/// This trait is the foundation of the Sans-IO architecture. It allows
/// protocol logic to be completely deterministic and testable.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `Instant`: Represents a point in time. In simulation, this is Turmoil's
///   virtual time. In production, this is `std::time::Instant`.
///
/// # Implementations
///
/// - Simulation (`kalandra-harness::SimEnv`): Virtual time that can be advanced
///   instantly, seeded RNG for reproducibility.
///
/// - Production (`kalandra-server::SystemEnv`): Real system clock,
///   crypto-secure RNG from OS entropy pool.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementations MUST guarantee:
///
/// 1. Time monotonicity: `now()` never goes backwards
/// 2. RNG quality: `random_bytes()` uses cryptographically secure entropy in
///    production
/// 3. Minimal panics: Methods are infallible except in exceptional
///    circumstances (e.g., OS entropy exhaustion, incorrect simulation setup)

    /// - `Sub<Output = Duration>` - Can compute elapsed time

    /// - Monotonicity: This method MUST return values that never decrease
    ///   within a single execution context. Subsequent calls must return times
    ///   >= previous calls.
