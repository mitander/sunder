//! Transport abstraction for network I/O.
//!
//! The `Transport` trait abstracts over connection-oriented transports that
//! support multiplexed streams. This matches the QUIC model:
//!
//! - **Connection**: Long-lived, can migrate between IPs, connection-level
//!   errors
//! - **Streams**: Short-lived, multiplexed over connection, cheap to create
//!
//! # Implementations
//!
//! - **`QuinnTransport`** (production): Uses QUIC connections and streams
//! - **`SimTransport`** (testing): Simulates QUIC semantics over Turmoil's TCP
//!
//! # Why Not Simulate QUIC Directly?
//!
//! Quinn does not support pluggable time/RNG providers, so deterministic
//! QUIC simulation would require forking Quinn indefinitely.
//!
//! Instead, we abstract at the **connection level** but simulate with TCP:
//!
//! - Kalandra's protocol logic lives inside QUIC streams
//! - We test Kalandra's correctness, not QUIC's reliability
//! - Turmoil's TCP provides identical stream semantics for testing
//!
//! # What We're NOT Testing
//!
//! - QUIC-specific behavior (0-RTT, loss recovery, congestion control)
//! - Connection migration between IPs
//! - UDP datagram delivery
//!
//! # What We ARE Testing
//!
//! - Kalandra protocol state machine correctness
//! - Message ordering and sequencing
//! - Timeout and retry logic
//! - Network fault handling
