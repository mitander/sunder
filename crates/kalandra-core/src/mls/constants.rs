//! MLS protocol constants
//!
//! This module defines constants used for MLS validation and protocol limits.

/// Maximum epoch number (sanity limit to prevent overflow)
///
/// This limit prevents:
/// - Integer overflow in epoch arithmetic
/// - Extremely long-running groups that might have key exhaustion
/// - Malicious frames claiming unreasonably high epochs
///
/// At 1 epoch/hour, this allows ~114 years of operation.
/// Real deployments will likely rotate groups much more frequently.
