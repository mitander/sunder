//! World state for scenario execution.

//! The World manages a single client-server connection pair during scenario
//! execution, tracks metrics, and provides oracle verification helpers.
//!
//! Note: We currently support only 1:1 scenarios (one client, one server).
//! Multi-actor scenarios will require turmoil integration for proper network
//! simulation.
