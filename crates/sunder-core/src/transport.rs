//! Transport abstraction for network I/O.
//!
//! The `Transport` trait abstracts over reliable, bidirectional byte streams.
//! This allows the same protocol logic to run over:
//!
//! - **QUIC streams** (production via Quinn)
//! - **TCP streams** (simulation via Turmoil)
//!
//! # Why Not Simulate QUIC Directly?
//!
//! Quinn does not support pluggable time/RNG providers, so deterministic
//! QUIC simulation would require forking Quinn indefinitely.
//!
//! Instead, we abstract at the **stream level**:
//!
//! - Sunder's protocol logic lives *inside* QUIC streams
//! - We test Sunder's correctness, not QUIC's reliability
//! - Turmoil's TCP provides identical stream semantics for testing
//!
//! # What We're NOT Testing
//!
//! - QUIC-specific behavior (connection migration, 0-RTT, loss recovery)
//! - UDP datagram delivery (we use reliable streams for control plane)
//! - Congestion control algorithms
//!
//! # What We ARE Testing
//!
//! - Sunder protocol state machine correctness
//! - Message ordering and sequencing
//! - Epoch transitions under network faults
//! - Timeout and retry logic

/// Abstract transport for reliable, ordered byte streams.
///
/// This trait represents a connection-oriented transport that provides
/// bidirectional byte streams with the following guarantees:
///
/// - **Reliability**: Bytes are delivered or an error is returned
/// - **Ordering**: Bytes arrive in the order they were sent
/// - **Flow Control**: Backpressure prevents sender from overwhelming receiver
///
/// # Implementations
///
/// - **`QuinnTransport`** (production): Uses QUIC bidirectional streams
/// - **`TurmoilTransport`** (simulation): Uses deterministic TCP streams
///
/// # Design Note: Why Bidirectional Streams?
///
/// QUIC supports unidirectional streams, but Sunder's protocol is
/// request-response oriented (client sends Frame, server responds with Frame).
/// Bidirectional streams simplify this pattern.
